This is an experiment in coding for the first time. I'm trying to make a program like Protobowl to read NHBB sets and allow users to buzz in real time. Currently, the app can't host multiple players--I'm looking into how to create servers and such.

To start the question, press "Next" (N on the keyboard after interacting with the window). A random question will be chosen and typed character by character on the page. At anytime, you can pause and resume the question with the corresponding buttons (p and r). Press "Buzz" (spacebar) when you think you know the answer to pause the question and bring up a text box to type it in. Pressing "answer" (enter) will display your answer at the bottom and reveal the rest of the question. Press "next" at  to move on to another question. 

Selecting "allow players to skip question" enables "next" permanently and allows you to move on to a different question at any time. Sliding the "speed" range slider changes the speed of the typing animation (taking effect on the next question). Left=faster, right=slower.

We're working on adding more questions over time. I'll try to get up multiplayer functionality soon!
