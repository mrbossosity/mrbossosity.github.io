This is an experiment in coding for the first time. I'm trying to make a program like Protobowl to read NHBB sets and allow users to buzz in real time.

#Manual
To start the question, press "Next". A random question will be chosen and will be typed character by character on the page. At anytime, you can pause and resume the question with the corresponding buttons. Pressing "Buzz" when you think you know the answer will pause the question and bring up a text box to type it in. Pressing "answer" will display your answer at the bottom and reveal the rest of the question. Press "next" at anytime to move on to another question.

I'm working on implementing a slider to control custom speed of the typing. I also will explore how to separate the questions and their answers into different attributes of each array object so that I can somehow get the program to recognize if your answer is right.
